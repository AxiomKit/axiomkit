## Overview

**AxiomKit** is a full-stack TypeScript framework for building truly autonomous AI
agents. It combines structured planning, adaptive memory, and explainable decision-making in one clean system, designed for:
- Autonomous task execution
- Stateful, long-running conversations
- Memory-backed decision making
- Multi-agent ecosystems
- Dynamic learning and adaptation

It‚Äôs a framework for building real AI agents, not just chatbots. Built for both
Node.js and browser environments.

### Key Features:
- ‚öôÔ∏è Modular TypeScript Architecture: Clean, extensible, and fully typed for robust development.
