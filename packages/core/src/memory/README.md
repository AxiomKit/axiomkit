# Axiomkit Memory System
## Scale Modular Architecture

## Multi-Tier Design:
- Working Memory (current execution state): Manages current execution state with automatic pruning
- Factual Memory (verified facts): Stores verified facts with confidence scoring and verification
- Episodic Memory (past experiences): Stores past experiences with temporal organization
- Semantic Memory (learned patterns): Learns patterns and concepts from interactions
- Graph Memory (entity relationships): Manages entity relationships and knowledge graphs
- Key-Value Memory (raw storage): Stores raw key-value pairs for quick access
- Vector Memory (semantic search): Stores vectors for semantic search and similarity matching

## Advanced Features
- Context-Aware Storage: Three-tier priority system (context-specific → global → legacy)
- Memory Evolution: Automatic consolidation, pattern detection, confidence updates
- Middleware System: Encryption, compression, audit logging, performance monitoring
- Memory Pressure Management: Configurable strategies (FIFO, LRU, Smart compression)
