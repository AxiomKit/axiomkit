## MCP Integration 
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables your agent to connect with external services and data sources through a unified interface - like giving it extra abilities from other applications.
With MCP, your agent acts as a headless client that can:
    - Connect to any MCP server, local or remote
    - Access server-provided resources, tools, and prompts
    - Use these new capabilities seamlessly with existing actions
    - Scale its reach by connecting to multiple servers at once

## Getting Started
To use MCP, you need to set up a client that connects to an MCP server. This client will handle communication with the server and allow your agent to use its resources.
