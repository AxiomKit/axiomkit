### Build a layer structure for sei
- [ ] Define the layers needed for sei (e.g., core, api, utils, etc.)
-[] create layer contract instead of using direct wallet of user
- [ ] Implement the layers with clear responsibilities and interfaces
- [ ] Write tests for each layer to ensure functionality and reliability
- [ ] Document the layer structure and usage guidelines for future reference
