## What is Axiomkit?

**Axiomkit** is a open-source **TypeScript** framework for building autonomous AI agents with advanced memory, reasoning, and action capabilities. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for creating intelligent systems that can:

* **Think and Reason** - Use powerful language models to analyze, plan, and make decisions
* **Remember and Learn** - Maintain structured memory across conversations and sessions
* **Act and Interact** - Execute actions, call APIs, and interact with external systems
* **Adapt and Scale** - Grow from simple scripts to complex production systems
## Why Axiomkit for Typescript?
Our vision is to give every developer the ability to build intelligent agents with the same confidence as they would any modern software. AxiomKit makes this possible through three core pillars:
    - **Unparalleled Developer Experience**: Built **TypeScript-first**, it delivers full type-safety and autocompletion right out of the box, so you can create powerful agents with minimal, readable code.
    - **Powerful & Flexible Architecture**: . Compose multiple agents, equip them with custom tools, and orchestrate complex workflows. Our provider-agnostic foundation means you're never locked into a single ecosystem.
## Core Philosophy

Axiomkit is built on the principle that AI agents should be **composable**, **extensible**, and **developer-friendly**. Every component is designed to work together seamlessly while remaining independently useful.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  **Advanced Memory System**
- **Working Memory**: Short-term context for active conversations
- **Episodic Memory**: Long-term storage of conversations and experiences
- **Vector Memory**: Semantic search across historical data
- **Graph Memory**: Relationship-based knowledge storage
- **Export Capabilities**: Export memories in JSON, Markdown, and other formats

### ðŸ”§ **Modular Architecture**
- **Contexts**: Isolated state containers for different domains
- **Actions**: Typed function interfaces for external interactions
- **Extensions**: Pluggable modules for platforms (Discord, Telegram, CLI)
- **Services**: Dependency injection for external resources

### ðŸŽ¯ **Type Safety**
- Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type inference
- Zod schemas for runtime validation
- IntelliSense support for all components

### ðŸš€ **Production Ready**
- Built-in logging and debugging tools
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Scalable architecture for high-load scenarios
- Comprehensive testing utilities
