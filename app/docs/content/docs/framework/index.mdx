## What is Axiomkit?

**Axiomkit** is a next-generation TypeScript framework for building autonomous AI agents with advanced memory, reasoning, and action capabilities. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for creating intelligent systems that can:

* **Think and Reason** - Use powerful language models to analyze, plan, and make decisions
* **Remember and Learn** - Maintain structured memory across conversations and sessions
* **Act and Interact** - Execute actions, call APIs, and interact with external systems
* **Adapt and Scale** - Grow from simple scripts to complex production systems

## Core Philosophy

Axiomkit is built on the principle that AI agents should be **composable**, **extensible**, and **developer-friendly**. Every component is designed to work together seamlessly while remaining independently useful.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  **Advanced Memory System**
- **Working Memory**: Short-term context for active conversations
- **Episodic Memory**: Long-term storage of conversations and experiences
- **Vector Memory**: Semantic search across historical data
- **Graph Memory**: Relationship-based knowledge storage
- **Export Capabilities**: Export memories in JSON, Markdown, and other formats

### ðŸ”§ **Modular Architecture**
- **Contexts**: Isolated state containers for different domains
- **Actions**: Typed function interfaces for external interactions
- **Extensions**: Pluggable modules for platforms (Discord, Telegram, CLI)
- **Services**: Dependency injection for external resources

### ðŸŽ¯ **Type Safety**
- Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type inference
- Zod schemas for runtime validation
- IntelliSense support for all components

### ðŸš€ **Production Ready**
- Built-in logging and debugging tools
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Scalable architecture for high-load scenarios
- Comprehensive testing utilities

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { createAgent } from "@axiomkit/core";
import { cliExtension } from "@axiomkit/cli";
import { groq } from "@ai-sdk/groq";

const agent = createAgent({
  model: groq("gemma2-9b-it"),
  extensions: [cliExtension],
});

await agent.start();
```
