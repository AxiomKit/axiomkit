# About Axiomkit

## What is Axiomkit?

**Axiomkit** is a next-generation TypeScript framework for building autonomous AI agents. It emphasizes:

* **Modularity** - Easily compose agents from reusable parts
* **Extensibility** - Add new capabilities via actions, adapters, and extensions
* **Scalability** - Build agents that can grow from simple scripts to full production systems
* **Advanced Autonomy** - Agents can plan, act, learn, and adapt in dynamic environments

## What is AI Agent?

An AI agent is a smart, self-directed assistant that can:

* **Listen** to external events (messages, API calls, time-based triggers).
* **Reason** using powerful models like GPT to decide what to do.
* **Act** by executing functions (e.g., send emails, update orders, query APIs).
* **Remember** past interactions to improve future decisions.

## Why Axiomkit?

In a crowded field of AI frameworks, **AxiomKit** stands out for developer-first design and deep agent capabilities:

#### ‚úÖ TypeScript-Native

* Full type safety&#x20;
* Clean, productive DX for developers
* Easily integrated into existing Node.js ecosystems

#### ‚úÖ Model-Agnostic

* Compatible with OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, and more
* Plug in any provider via `@ai-sdk` abstraction

#### ‚úÖ Agent Autonomy

* **Dynamic Re-Planning**: Agents can detect failed plans and re-evaluate goals in response to changing environments
* **Self-Correction Loops**: Built-in mechanisms for agents to reflect, assess outcomes, and optimize strategies over time

#### ‚úÖ Flexible Memory System

* Structured short-term and long-term memory
* Contextual queries: _‚ÄúWhat did I discuss with User A about Project X last week?‚Äù_
* Supports multi-session and multi-user continuity

#### ‚úÖ Scalable Plugin System

* Extend agents with production-grade integrations for Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and more
* Extend behavior via reusable `actions`, `contexts`, and `extensions`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

| Component         | Function                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Runtime** | Orchestrates event processing, action dispatch, and memory usage       |
| **Contexts**      | Isolated memory/state containers for conversations, tasks, or domains  |
| **Actions**       | Declarative function interfaces for the agent to interact with systems |
| **Memory**        | Structured state persistence with retrieval and summarization APIs     |
| **Extensions**    | Pluggable modules bundling actions, adapters, and custom logic         |
| **LLM Providers** | Abstracts interaction with any supported language model                |
|                   |                                                                        |

### üë• Who Should Use AxiomKit?

* Developers building AI-first applications
* Teams deploying domain-specific intelligent agents
* Researchers designing memory-aware, goal-driven AI systems
* Projects integrating AI with social platforms, CRMs, blockchains, or internal tools
