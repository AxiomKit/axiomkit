## Writing Guidelines

### Code Examples
- Always include complete, runnable code examples
- Use TypeScript with proper type annotations
- Include comments explaining complex parts
- Show both simple and advanced usage patterns
- Reference actual examples from the codebase when possible

### Explanations
- Write for developers with varying experience levels
- Use concrete examples and analogies
- Explain the "why" behind design decisions
- Include performance considerations when relevant
- Mention limitations and trade-offs

### Structure
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Break complex topics into digestible sections
- Use numbered lists for step-by-step instructions
- Use bullet points for feature lists and options
- Include visual cues (emojis, icons) for better readability

### Technical Accuracy
- All code examples must be tested and working
- API references must match the actual implementation
- Version numbers and dependencies must be current
- Cross-reference related documentation when appropriate
